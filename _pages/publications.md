## My other experience

Outside of data world, I used to work as a Store Manager for a F&B service for 6 months, a place where I developed my skills in effective communication and teamwork, as well as my awareness of responsibility in the workplace.
What I have done at the branch to contribute to its growth is:
- Analyzing and tracking customer purchased data from various sources, including POS and internal website data.
- Assist the marketing team in launching a new product and increasing sales by 10%.
- Monthly branch performance report to supervisor (includes monitoring products, customers, etc.)
- Monitoring staff performance, work schedules, inventory, and customer service for continued revenue growth and staying at the top of the branch with the highest average value per order.Â
