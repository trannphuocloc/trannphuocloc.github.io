# My other experience

Below this line, that's a summary of  my other experience before I got into the data career path. If you are considering how my other skills, like effective communication, teamwork, and my attitude at work were built, it's for you. If you are not interested, please skip this part and check my CV above and [my portfolio](https://trannphuocloc.github.io/portfolio/) instead.

All of my projects in data analytics show you my technical skills in SQL and PowerBI. Outside of my portfolio, in this introduction section, I want to introduce the experience that I had before I moved onto the data career path.

I used to work as a staff member at the FnB service branch. I spent six months performing excellently in my role and got nominated for the Shift Leader position. Here, I had experience in: 
- Operation management (including managing staff, customer services, and infrastructure maintenance)
- Performance tracking and 
- Monthly report to General Manager.
  
By taking care of all the work, helped me build my attitude, such as high responsibility and meticulousness in tasks, especially in numbers, and effective communication with staff and managers.
