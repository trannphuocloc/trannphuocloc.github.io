## My other experience

Outside of the data world, I used to work as a Branch Manager for an F&B service where I developed my skills in effective communication and teamwork, as well as my professional attitude of responsibility in workplaces.
What I have done at the branch to contribute to its growth is:
- Analyzing customer-purchased data from various sources, including POS and internal website data, to
determine product appeals and reduce monthly inconsistencies between physical and accounting records.
- Collaborate with marketing, and supply chain departments to launch new products that resulted in a 10%
increase in sales.
- Monthly branch performance report to supervisor (includes competitor research, monitoring products,
customer engagements, suggesting branch development, etc.)

Achievements:
- The top branch has the highest revenue per day in the Tet 2023 competition and the highest value per order.
- Report quality is accredited by conducting a detailed analysis of the branch's key aspects and proposing
appropriate solutions.
