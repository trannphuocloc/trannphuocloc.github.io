Hi there! My name's Tran Phuoc Loc, a fourth-year student at Ho Chi Minh City Open University, pursuing a degree in International Economics.

I built this page for the purpose of uploading my personal projects in Data Analytics currently and more projects in Data Science in the future.

I'm aiming to write blogs in tech, business, cryptocurrencies, international economic news, and more lately.

Feel free to take a look at the projects I've done, and if you have any feedback or inquiries about the projects, don't hesitate to contact me for more information.
