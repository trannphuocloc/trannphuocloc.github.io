Hi there! Glad to see you here, and I appreciate your taking the time to check out my website.

My name’s Tran Phuoc Loc, a final-year student at Ho Chi Minh City Open University pursuing a degree in International Economics.

I built this page for the purpose of uploading my personal projects in Data Analytics currently and more Data Science projects. I aim to write blogs in tech, business, cryptocurrencies, global economic news, etc., and put them here in the near future.

Feel free to take a look at the projects I’ve done, and if you have any feedback or inquiries about the projects, don’t hesitate to contact me.
