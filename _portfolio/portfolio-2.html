And csv files that include employee data, check [my repository](https://github.com/trannphuocloc/HR-dataset-project) here for the data.

So, let's dive into these project details

Start creating a join table for the whole dataset to ensure that we do not misclaim the employee information from HR.

Input [1]:
```
SELECT * FROM Absenteeism_at_work a
LEFT JOIN compensation b
ON a.ID = b.ID
LEFT JOIN Reasons c
