        <td>Highest value loyal customers who score a 5 in recency value and a 4-5 in frequency + monetary value. These are repeat purchasers who are getting serious value from your product, they’re coming back all the time to spend a lot, and they’re likely brand evangelists at this point.</td>
        <td> Despite your gut instinct to leave this group on autopilot since they’re frequent purchasers who spend a lot, you should definitely do more to reward them for their loyalty.
            Consider: 
            <ul>
                <li>Giving them exclusive offers</li>
                <li>Implementing loyalty rewards or increasing their loyalty rewards</li>
                <li>Providing them with early access to new products</li>
                <li>Inviting them to leave you a review</li>
