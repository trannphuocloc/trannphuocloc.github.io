        <td>555, 554, 544, 545, 454, 455, 445</td>
        <td>Highest value loyal customers who score a 5 in recency value and a 4-5 in frequency + monetary value. These are repeat purchasers who are getting serious value from your product, they’re coming back all the time to spend a lot, and they’re likely brand evangelists at this point.</td>
        <td> Despite your gut instinct to leave this group on autopilot since they’re frequent purchasers who spend a lot, you should definitely do more to reward them for their loyalty.
Consider: 
            <ul>
                <li>Giving them exclusive offers</li>
                <li>Implementing loyalty rewards or increasing their loyalty rewards</li>
                <li>Providing them with early access to new products</li>
                <li>Inviting them to leave you a review</li>
            </ul>

        <td>Loyal customers</td>
        <td>543, 444, 435, 355, 354, 345, 344, 335</td>
        <td>They are your 2nd highest value group, just below your brand Champions. Scoring a 3-4 on recency (meaning they’ve purchased fairly recently) and 4-5 on frequency + monetary value, means they’re big fans of your brand. Time to treat them like it to convert them into brand Champions! </td>
        <td>This is another group you can’t ignore because they’re hooked on your products. Their frequency and monetary scores are among your highest, but their recency isn’t quite there – it’s been a little while since they purchased.
            <ul>
                <li>Pitch your top-tier loyalty rewards</li>
                <li>Invite them to subscribe (if you offer subscriptions)</li>
                <li>Tell them about new product releases</li>
                <li>Invite them to follow on social media to enhance the brand experience</li>
            </ul>

        <td>There’s SO much potential in this group! Your Potential Loyalists have purchased recently (scoring a 4-5) and are in the 2-3 range for frequency and monetary value. Your products and brand are fresh in mind because they just made a purchase, but historically, they’re not buying a super high quantity or spending at the highest level. It’s time to draw them in to become more affiliated with your brand.</td>
