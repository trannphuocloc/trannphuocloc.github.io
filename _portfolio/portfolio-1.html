<h2>RFM Summary</h2>
<body>
    <p>RFM Analysis is a measurement technique that uses existing customer behavior data, based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary value of purchases, to predict how customers will act in the future as well as to group them into behavioral segments.</p>
    <p>RFM can help you answer these questions and more:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who can you upsell higher-value products to?</li>
        <li>Who can you send personalized messages to keep them from churning?</li>
        <li>Who is most likely to engage with your brand?</li>
        <li>Who can you offer limited-time offers to and try to reactivate?</li>
	<li>...</li>
    </ul>
<p>For our visualization, three dimensions of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary coincide with 3D graphics. However, it doesn't work effectively and difficult to understand the result. By combining Frequency and Monetary and turning it to 2D, it is much easier to understand because when a customer subscribes to a month for 100 dollar 12 times in 12 months, it is equivalent to when customers subscribe for $1200 per year all at once. At that time, Recency represented the customer's engagement with our brand.</p>

<p>Having 11 customer segments have the same behavior as the table that we will group them into:</p>
