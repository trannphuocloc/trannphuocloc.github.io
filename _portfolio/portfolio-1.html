    <p>RFM Analysis is a measurement technique that uses existing customer behavior data, based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary value of purchases, to predict how customers will act in the future as well as to group them into behavioral segments.</p>
    <p>RFM can help you answer these questions and more:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who can you upsell higher-value products to?</li>
        <li>Who can you send personalized messages to keep them from churning?</li>
        <li>Who is most likely to engage with your brand?</li>
        <li>Who can you offer limited-time offers to and try to reactivate?</li>
    </ul>
